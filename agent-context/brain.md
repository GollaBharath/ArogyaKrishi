# Project Brain

You are an engineering agent working on an MVP for a farmer-focused crop disease detection system.

Primary Goal:

- Build a scalable Python backend (FastAPI) that performs plant disease detection from images and returns actionable guidance.

Constraints:

- 24-hour hackathon MVP
- Prefer correctness and simplicity over completeness
- No overengineering
- No speculative features unless explicitly requested

Non-Goals:

- No on-device ML
- No regulatory or medical guarantees
- No production-grade security

Operating Rules:

- Do one task at a time
- Ask before moving to the next task
- Produce minimal, working code
- Explain assumptions clearly
